#### Bluemix Mobile services Dependency Management

This starter uses the Bluemix Mobile services SDKs to use the functionality of the Mobile Analytics and Push Notifications services.

The Bluemix Mobile services SDK uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to manage and configure dependencies. To use our latest SDKs, you need version 1.1.0.rc.2.

You can install CocoaPods using the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods --pre
```

If the CocoaPods repository is not configured, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod setup
```

For this starter, a pre-configured `Podfile` is included in the **ios_swift/Podfile** location. To download and install the required dependencies, run the following command in the **ios_swift** directory:

```bash
$ pod install
```
Open the Xcode workspace: `{APP_Name}.xcworkspace`. Continue to open the `.xcworkspace` file as it contains all the dependencies and configurations.

If you run into any issues during the pod install, it is recommended to run a pod update by using the following commands:

```bash
$ pod update
$ pod install
```
